# Linux, Cloud & Security Infrastructure Homelab

A hands-on infrastructure engineering homelab documenting practical experience across Linux administration, containerization, networking, security, cloud infrastructure, and Infrastructure as Code.

The project begins with locally hosted infrastructure on Linux and progressively moves toward AWS, Terraform, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure security.

---

## Current Architecture

![Local Infrastructure Architecture](diagrams/local-infrastructure-architecture.png)

The current environment uses a Linux Mint physical host running an Ubuntu Server virtual machine through KVM/QEMU. Docker Compose manages an isolated container network containing an Nginx reverse proxy and two backend application containers.

HTTP requests received on port `8080` are redirected to HTTPS on port `8443`. Nginx terminates TLS and uses hostname-based routing to direct requests for `app1.lab` and `app2.lab` to their respective backend containers.

The backend application containers are not directly exposed through host ports.

The current environment is hosted entirely inside the local homelab and is not publicly exposed to the Internet.

## Troubleshooting Philosophy

The labs emphasize identifying the failing infrastructure layer before changing configuration.

For a containerized web application, the troubleshooting process generally follows:

```text
Client
  |
  v
Name Resolution
  |
  v
Network Connectivity
  |
  v
Host Port
  |
  v
Docker
  |
  v
Reverse Proxy
  |
  v
Application Routing
  |
  v
Backend Service
```

This methodology was used to diagnose issues including:

- Docker socket permissions
- Host port conflicts
- Reverse proxy startup failures
- HTTP 404 responses
- Nginx path-routing behavior
- Hostname resolution
- TLS certificate trust

---

## Security Approach

Security is treated as part of infrastructure design rather than an isolated final step.

The repository intentionally excludes sensitive material including:

```text
Private keys
Cloud credentials
Secrets
Tokens
Local TLS certificate material
Terraform state
```

Configuration committed to this repository is intended to remain reproducible without exposing environment-specific secrets.
